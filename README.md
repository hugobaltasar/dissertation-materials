# Replication materials of my Ph.D. dissertation
This is Stata code to replicate all results, graphs and tables of my doctoral thesis.

Clone the repository or download the do files to your computer and run the `main` file of each chapter, starting with `chapter-3-main`. 

You will need to install the user-written programs [`iop`](https://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0361), [`fastgini`](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s456814.html), [`esttab`](https://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0085_1) and `grc1leg2`.

Notice that I am not entitled to distribute the microdata I use, the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions. These data are distributed by Eurostat only, and you must have access to it in order to use this code.
